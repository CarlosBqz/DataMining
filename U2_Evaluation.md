# INTRODUCTION

## Evaluation Practice Unit 2

In this practice we are asked to create the code according to an image of a graph provided with certain data to follow, which contains different information which refers to a csv file where we will create data frames for the proper handling of data, to chart, customize graphics and text among other functions within the code.

# INSTRUCTIONS

Develop the following problem with R and RStudio for the knowledge extraction that the problem requires. 

The film review website managers are very happy with their previous delivery and now have a new requirement for you. 

However, the R-code used to create the graph has been lost and cannot be recovered. 
Your task is to create the code that will recreate the same table making it look as close as possible to the original. 

# DEVELOPMENT

We start our code by loading the csv into our environment, for this we choose to use a different way of loading files: "read.csv (file.choose ())" this method will allow us to manually choose the file using our browser file.
 
    mydata <- read.csv(file.choose())

Then we will load our graphics library which is "ggplot2"

    library(ggplot2)

Since we have loaded our csv file where we have too much data that really only need a few, so we filter the information in this case will be the genres of different films.

    #filtro1
    filtro <- (mydata$Genre == "action") | (mydata$Genre == "adventure") | (mydata$Genre == "animation") | (mydata$Genre == "comedy") | (mydata$Genre == "drama")

We created our second filter that will be on the name of the studios that make movies. 

    #filtro2
    filtro2 <- mydata$Studio %in% c("Buena Vista Studios", "WB", "Fox", "Universal", "Sony", "Paramount Studios")
    filtro
    filtro2
 
 After having created the second filter, we generate a second data frame taking as a starting point the filters 1 and 2.

    mydata2 <- mydata[filtro & filtro2,]
    mydata2

### We generate the graphic where:

- We use mydata2 where the data is already filtered.
- As the graph we are looking for has in the "X" axis to Genre and in "Y" to Gross in US, we declare the x and y axes with those values.
- Then we create in the graph a series of points, with the geometry jitter function, where we give them as parameters:
   1. size=Budget so that the size of the points generated by jitter vary depending on the budget.
   2. color=Studio so that each point has a particular color depending on the studio that developed the film.
- Then we generate a boxplot, where we give the parameters alpha=0.8 to control the size of the boxes and outlier.color=NA to delete the data that are not in the conditions we gave.
- The function scale_size_continuous works to give a gradual size to the points.
- xlab and ylab work to give a custom title to the x and y axes.
- ggtitle is to give a custom title to the graph.
- The theme function works to manipulate the size, color and font of the labels generated earlier. 
 1. axis.title.x / axis.title.y work to manipulate the size and color of the x- and y-axis titles.
 2. axis.text.x / axis.text.y work to manipulate the size and color of the texts in the x and y axes that are in the graphic.
 3. plot.title works to manipulate the title of the chart.
 4. legend.title works to manipulate the size of the legends, in this case they are on the right, they are Studio and Budget.
 5. text in this case we use it to give a specific font to the texts.
 
```r
 grafica <- ggplot(data=mydata2, aes(x=Genre, y=Gross...US))+
  geom_jitter(aes(size=Budget...mill., colour=Studio))+
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.8, outlier.color = NA)+
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 3))+
  xlab("Genre")+
  ylab("Gross % US")+
  ggtitle("Domestic Gross % by Genre")+
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_text(colour = "Blue", size=15),
    axis.title.y = element_text(colour = "Blue", size=15),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size=10),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size=10),
    plot.title = element_text(size=20),
    legend.title = element_text(size=10),
    text = element_text(family = "sans")
  )
grafica
```

 ### Conclusion
In this practice we learned that from many data can be generated very informative graphs with only a few filters and data frames created, it seemed very complicated to generate a graph similar to that was presented but as it was generating the code was taking the form very close to the required.

In the end we were able to compare the graphs and if the challenge of being able to represent it as it is thanks to the data and customization of the graph was met.
