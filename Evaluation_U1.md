In this evaluation we were specified the points that should be made in R to generate the code and to be able to represent the graphs according to the same data provided, in this practice we used vectors, data frames, filters, among other functions in order to interpret the data.

A scatter-plot should be generated showing the statistics of life expectancy (y-axis) and fertility rate (x-axis) by country. The scatterplot should also be sorted by country regions. You have been provided with data for 2 years: 1960 and 2013 and are required to produce a visualization for each of these years.
